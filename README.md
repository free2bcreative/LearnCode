#Learning To Code
As I've gone through college computer science courses, I've discovered something:  I have to relearn certain things over and over.  Though it is good to have repetition when learning, I think it would have been nicer to have a centralized place for all of my findings.  That way, I could easily relearn without having to search too far.

For example, let's say I tried to find a good tutorial on async testing with QUnit and Javascript.  After many Google searches, I finally found something.  

Fast foward 1 year later when I need to do that same thing again.  What if I could just go to this repository and find what I need to find real fast.  
I hope to post good explainations, urls to helpful sites, and links to YouTube tutorials (including my own).  

If this is helpful to anyone else out there, hurray!  I'm glad I could help.  I usually learn better when I teach someone else.
